## Something about your voice
Where my parents live they still use an old-fashioned doorbell without cameras. From their house you can't see who rang the bell, so the only way to know who's at the door is by asking "Who's there?".
I have almost never answered with "Hi, it's Dario", but have alwyas come up with either a new name "Hey, this is Matteo", or a new job: "Good morning, I'd like to leave a package for...".
Yet, the answer on the other side has always beeen: "Come on in Dario".
Despite changing the content of the message, and despite the poor quality of the intercomm system, my parents always recognized my voice.. but, how?
There must be something unique about everyone's voice that people who know us pick up very easily.

When building AI solutions I always try to first ask myself: "How is a human solving this problem?"
When it comes down to Speaker Recognition it seems like that we rely on a signature in our voice that makes it unique, a "Voice Fingeprint".

## Speaker Diarization for Webex Meetings

Speaker Diarization answers the question: "Who spoke when?".
Answering this question is very important for meeting recordings. Webex Meetings recordings are provided with transcriptions.
This allows colleagues who might have missed meeting to quickly catch up with what was said, together with being able to provide automatic highlights and summaries.
This is very useful, but without knowing who said what, it is more difficult for humans to skim through the content, and for AI solutions to provide more accurate results.
